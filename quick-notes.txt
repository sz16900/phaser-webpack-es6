- use nvm to make sure you are using the right node version
- some commands to consider:
    + node -v
    + cd -> to home
    + la -> lists all files even the hidden
    + nano .bashrc -> to write into the bash file
    + source $HOME/.bashrc -> to refresh the terminal 
    + nvm ls-remote -> lists ALL node version (so pick the current one)
    + nvm install v12.18.3 -> (this was the version I ended up using)
    + nvm use v12.18.3 -> (this was the version I ended up using)
    + node -v -> to make sure I am using the right version
- it seems like webpack 4 deprecated new webpack.optimize.CommonChunkPlugin({})
- instead i used:   optimization: {
                                        splitChunks: {
                                            cacheGroups: {
                                                commons: {
                                                name: 'production-dependencies',
                                                chunks: 'initial',
                                                minChunks: 2,
                                                },
                                            },
                                        },
                                    },
